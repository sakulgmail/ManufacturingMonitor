Logo File Management Instructions
=====================================

To change the application logo:

1. Replace any of these files in this directory:
   - logo.png (recommended)
   - logo.jpg
   - logo.jpeg
   - logo.gif

2. The system will automatically try these formats in order:
   - First: logo.png
   - Then: logo.jpg
   - Then: logo.jpeg
   - Finally: logo.gif

3. If no logo file is found, the system will show the default icon.

4. After replacing the logo file, the new logo will appear immediately 
   (no server restart required).

Logo Requirements:
- Recommended size: 64x64 pixels (will be automatically resized)
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF
- Keep file size reasonable for web use (under 1MB recommended)

Current logo file: logo.png (sample logo - replace with your own)
